### Things to know when Pair Programming with me:

1. I love to document and write comments in my code and feel very unorganized without doing so. Although, I am still new to documentation and would love to hear tips and learn more about it.

2. Communication is a must for me. If either partner does not understand a line of code at any point, I like to stop there and go through it until there is mutual understanding.

3. I love to learn from others! There are tons of ways to solve the same problem, so if you know a better way then please speak up.
